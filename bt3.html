					 <h3>How Continuous Learning Initiatives are Driving Success for Employers and Their Top Talent</h3>
					 <p>As a leader in the technology space, most of your workforce is already aware of, if not personally invested in, some form of professional development. That fact represents a big shift in what we’ve come to think of as the “learners journey.” Rather than seeing continuous learning as a necessary evil, many of today’s most in-demand technology professionals are actually looking to their employers to take an active role in their ongoing professional and technical growth. Many, even make it a top consideration when choosing employment.

	On the other side of the coin, the same employers are often in a near-constant battle with the three-headed monster of managing increased global integration, skills obsolescence, and rapidly iterating technology landscape. The notion of deeply embedded continuous learning programs isn’t just a nicety anymore. It’s a reality of doing business in the 21st century.</p>

					 <h3>What is Continuous Learning?</h3>
					 <p>Since we know that the challenges of the modern marketplace are driving a variety of learning and development based imperatives, let’s dig in. What specifically defines a continuous learning program. What are the benefits and how can we start building one? Rule one? Continuous learning should not be confused with the broader concepts of continuing education.

	Continuous learning is the application of deeply integrated educational strategies that drive growth through iterative just-in-time micro-learning experiences implemented over an extended period of time. Almost by definition, continuous learning is a two-part dance. It requires long term investment, both in building the infrastructure to support it as well as a culture that celebrates learning as a primary business objective unto itself. </p>

					 <h3>Employee Happiness and Retention</h3>
					 <p>We’ve known for years that employers who prioritize upskilling or reskilling as a method of professional development see lower attrition and therefore reduced hiring costs. Providing opportunities to learn is key to job satisfaction and aids in retention. According to a workplace survey conducted by LinkedIn, 94 percent of employees would stay at a company longer if it invested in their career. If an organization can support and improve employees’ competencies via continuous learning, the organization benefits from retaining these skilled employees and the employees are in turn happier in their jobs.</p>

					 <h3>Making You More Scalable</h3>
					 <p>With new skills in-house, your organization may more easily develop new products and services, or expand into new markets. While not every employee has to completely transform and acquire a net-new skill set, the continuous dissemination of information across the organization can empower everyone. Diverse teams like sales, customer care, and operations, armed with a stronger understanding of the company’s products and services, can utilize this information to seize opportunity and perform more successfully in their roles.</p>

					 <h3>The Benefits of Continuous Learning</h3>
					 <p>We know that continuous learning initiatives have some obvious potential upsides for employers and employees as well as you, the organizational leader. They often become a broad catalyst for compounded ROI by developing a more competitive talent pool which leads to better products and eventually to sales. For employees, the ability to continue developing those products with a wide latitude of expertise.

	There is quite a bit of collateral value as well though, including some less obvious outcomes that could be the difference between getting your team on board to build a continuous learning program or not.</p>

					 <h3>Fundamentals of a Continuous Learning Program</h3>
					 <p>Finally, we defined continuous learning in the first part of this post as “The application of deeply integrated educational strategies that drive iterative growth through just-in-time micro-learning experiences and implemented over an extended period of time.” That’s a mouthful, so let’s break that down a bit:</p>
