				  <h4>Our efforts</h4>
				  <p>We want to be sure each camper and volunteer has what theyneed to participate in our virtual programs. Camp One Step launched a technology initiative where campers can check out iPads for the duration of a Camp One Step program. We will ship you the device with a return label to make it an easy process! If you would like to borrow an iPad or are in need of any other technical support, please contact Darryl at dperkins@CampOneStep.org.</p>

				  <h4>My Experience</h4>
				  <p>Many years have passed since I have had the opportunity to visit with Dr. Baum but the memories of our time together and his wisdom will remain with me forever. I truly believe that I am here today, the Medical Director at Camp One Step, because of him. He took a chance on me when he opened that letter in 1983, just like he has so many times with so many others. I consider myself one of the “lucky ones” because our paths crossed, and his friendship a true blessing – I know that there are so many more who feel the same way that I do. We are forever grateful to him for his vision, guidance, inspiration and friendship, and strive every day to continue the work that he started, taking it one step at a time. I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson said it best with these words, “Do not go where the path may lead. But go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.”
We will miss you, dear friend, but the imprint that you made on our hearts will live forever!</p>
